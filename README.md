# machine-and-women
let's try and make machine understand women!
For ages now men have been struggling to understand women! for those few who understood,
fewer tried to make the world understand, by writing poems and stories, today in this blog
I tried to use the poems from legendary modern writers and women who wrote about "women".
The data are a set of poems! extraordinarily written to describe women (most of them never
made sense to me though, but definitely to people who understand them!) trying to see 
if, machines build with recurrent neural networks with L.S.T.M. layers could understand,
and recreate a piece similar, to what these authors have written, definitely, 
we are not going to see a particular style of writing, because different authors write differently,
I prepossessed lines to look similar in text data. Let's find out how things turn to!
